  - [x] Implement user roles and permissions within the CRM context.
- [ ] **Implement the `dashboard` app** to manage all feature apps.
  - [ ] Create an initial dashboard layout with links to all current apps (`auth_app`, `crm`).
  - [ ] Integrate basic functionalities (e.g., user management, app navigation).
  - [ ] Provide a centralized view for admins and managers to monitor app status and user activities.

### **Sprint 2: Develop Website, CMS, and Additional Core Apps**
- [ ] Develop the `website` app to simulate user interaction.
- [ ] Implement the `cms` app to allow users to edit, update, and post content.
- [ ] Begin implementation of the `payment` app for simulating payment processing as a feature on the `website` app.
- [ ] Implement `email_service` app for managing email communication.
- [ ] Build the `cloud_storage` app for secure file storage and retrieval.
- [ ] Create `document_management` app for document handling.

### **Sprint 3: Develop Additional Apps and Features**
- [ ] Develop the `communication` app for live chat, notifications, and messaging.
- [ ] Build the `analytics` app for reporting and data visualization.
- [ ] Continue to expand the `dashboard` app to integrate additional apps and features.
- [ ] Start initial development on other key apps:
  - [ ] `ticketing`, `feedback`, `lms`, `chatbot`, `appointment`, `workflow_automation`, `marketing`, `client_portal`, `hr_management`, `internal_communication`.

## **Future Enhancements**

### **Planned Improvements and Security Enhancements**
- [ ] Move sensitive settings (like `SECRET_KEY` and database credentials) to environment variables.
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL database to replace SQLite, set up multiple databases, and implement custom database routers.
- [ ] Add additional security settings and middleware for production, such as `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`, `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`, and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`.
- [ ] Set up logging to capture errors and important events for debugging and monitoring.
- [ ] Refactor `settings.py` to use a more modular and environment-based configuration (e.g., development vs. production settings).
- [ ] Implement additional password validation rules or custom validators for enhanced security.
- [ ] Implement cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database for better scalability and management.

### **Testing and Deployment Planning**
- [ ] Develop a comprehensive testing plan, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all critical components.
- [ ] Prepare for deployment by setting up necessary infrastructure (e.g., web server, database server) and ensuring the project is production-ready.
- [ ] Develop a deployment checklist and script for automating the deployment process.

### **Long-Term Goals**
- [ ] Set up Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Explore potential third-party integrations for extended functionalities.
- [ ] Open-source the project for community contributions and feedback.
- [ ] Scale the system to support a larger user base and more complex use cases.

### **Future Scope**
- [ ] Consider building a mobile app to complement the web interface for enhanced user engagement.
- [ ] Expand chatbot functionalities with AI-based predictive responses and integrate with other communication tools.
- [ ] Integrate machine learning tools for advanced data analytics and predictive modeling.
- [ ] Add additional self-service options in the client portal, such as real-time status updates and dynamic form generation.
- [ ] Investigate the feasibility of implementing a multi-tenancy architecture for different client types.
